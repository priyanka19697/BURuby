1. This throws a superclasss mismatch error. This is because ruby doesnt allow multiple inheritance.

2. instance variables are represented with @ ,
   class variables are represented with @@.

   instance variables are private for each instance but all of them share the same class variable.

3. super keyword allows us to refer to the method of parent class from child class

4. attr_reader makes the data of a method in class available to access
 def method
    @method
 end 
 def method=(value)
    @method = value
 end
   attr_writer makes it writable from outside

5. require - gives us access to modules
   include - lets us use all methods of module as instance methods
   extend - lets us use all methods as class methods
